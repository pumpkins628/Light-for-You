## üíª Software Setup

1. ### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/pumpkins628/Light-for-You.git
cd Light-for-You
```

2. ### Upload Code

 - Open the Arduino IDE.
- Find the `Code/LED_suit_vest_bluetooth` folder and open the `LED_suit_vest_bluetooth.ino` file.
  Upload this code to the Arduino Nano, which you want to use to control the vest.
- Find the `Code/control` folder and open the `control.ino` file.
  Upload this code to the Arduino Nano, which you want to use to connect the light on the vest.

üö® **Library Setup**
<br>
- Don't forget to import the required libraries into the Arduino IDE:
The necessary libraries can be found in the `Test` folder.
- To import a library, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library... in the Arduino IDE, then select the relevant library files from the `Test` folder.

## üö¥‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

### Power On
- Turn on the vest and remote by clicking their own switches.

### Control Signals
- **Left Turn**: Press the left button on the remote or turn the handlebars left.
- **Right Turn**: Press the right button on the remote or turn the handlebars right.
- **Hazard Lights**: Press the middle button on the remote to activate the hazard lights.

### Ride Safely
